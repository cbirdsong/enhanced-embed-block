# Enhanced Embed Block for YouTube

A WordPress plugin for better user experience and faster page loads on any page with a YouTube video.

## What this plugin does

This plugin makes the default WordPress YouTube Embed block infinitely better by replacing each video with the [`lite-youtube` custom element](https://github.com/justinribeiro/lite-youtube).

The plugin further improves things by providing a no-JS fallback and ensuring that the video placeholder doesn't cause a layout shift from when the page loads to when the custom element is initialized.
